# Employee Income Prediction Project üíº

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline designed to predict whether an individual's annual income is greater than $50,000 or less than or equal to $50,000. The prediction is based on census data, and the final model is deployed as an interactive web application.

### **Project Overview**

The core of this project is a binary classification task. Using the "Adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we analyze demographic and employment-related attributes to build a predictive model. The project covers the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and finally, deployment as a user-friendly web app.

### **‚ú® Features of the Web App**

The deployed application, built with Streamlit, offers two primary modes of prediction:

* **Single Prediction:** Users can manually input an individual's details (age, workclass, education, etc.) through a sidebar form to get an instant income class prediction.
* **Batch Prediction:** Users can upload a CSV file containing multiple employee records. The application processes the file and returns the original data with an added "Predicted Income" column, which can then be downloaded.

### **ü§ñ Model Performance**

Several classification algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. The best-performing model was the **Gradient Boosting Classifier**, which achieved an accuracy of **85.81%** on the test set. This model was saved and used for the final deployment.
